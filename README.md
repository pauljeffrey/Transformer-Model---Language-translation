# Transformer-Model---Language-translation
Transformer model trained to translate portugese to english.

## INTRODUCTION
A Transfomer (with multihead attention) sequence to sequence model trained on portugese-english dataset to a loss of 0.27. Model was built from scratch in TensorFlow

## INPUT
portugese text

## OUTPUT
English text 

# METHOD
The input text is preprocessed and then passed to an encoder transformer. The output of this transformer is then passed to a decoder transformer that produces the final output
of the model.
